## *Predicting The Level Of Financial Inclusion Among Mobile Subscribers*

### Abstract

With mobile money rapidly expanding from its original role as a payment service to a platform for customers to gain access to a broader array of financial services, the survival prospects for traditional banks, mico-lenders and other traditional financial service providers will greately depend not only on their ability to effectively target the financially excluded, but also to enter into strategic partnerships with telecom operators and identify individuals on the mobile network who are most likely to use financial products and services (i.e. savings, credit, insurance) in addition to mobile money. 

In this project, I apply machine learning to induce a model to classify an individual into one of four categories based on mobile money and financial service use. I test the approach using Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers and evaluate their performance on a dataset containing socio-economic and demographic information on approximately 7,100 individuals across Tanzania. The models identify the key drivers of mobile money and financial service use as frequency and recency of financial transactions, mobile phone ownership, regional location and the level of education achieved. The best model has an overall accuracy of 67.2%. These results demonstrate the potential for the use of machine learning to refine customer targeting and cross-selling strategies.
